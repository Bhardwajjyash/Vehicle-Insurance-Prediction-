# Vehicle-Insurance-Prediction-
In this project, I used machine learning techniques to develop a prediction model that classifies whether a customer is likely to purchase vehicle insurance or not. The steps involved were:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary features and handling missing values.

Class Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset, since most customers were not interested.

Model Building: Tried different models â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Model Selection: Chose Random Forest Classifier as the final model because it performed best in terms of recall, accuracy, and F1-score for both classes.

Model Explainability: Used feature importance from Random Forest to understand which features most influenced predictions, such as Age, Policy Sales Channel, and Annual Premium.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to measure performance.

This model can now help the business focus marketing efforts on the right group of people, improving overall campaign success and cost-efficiency.
